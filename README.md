## NiceJobs:

### Currently working on this project...

#### Description:
This project is an experiment. I aim to slowly polish it over time.

Starting from an ugly duckling, and turning it to a beautiful enterprise level swan.

#### This project uses:
Tailwind, Sass, Typescript, Angular, Storybook (soon), ngrx (soon) and possibly other libraries later on.

The backend doesn't exist yet, but it will most likely be written in Kotlin (either Ktor or Spring Boot)
